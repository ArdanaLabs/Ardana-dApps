# Installation

> nix-env -iA nixpkgs.selenium-server-standalone


# Running

## Tests based on `webdriver` package

> selenium-server

In another shell:

> cabal test webdriver


## Tests based on `sydtest-webdriver` package

> cabal test sydtest-webdriver

Notes

- this doesn't work (error message: `ResponseTimeout`, probably from the `webdriver-standalone` executable)
- currently just one test case is given, randomized property tests are missing


# TODOs

1.  nixify
2.  fix the solution using `sydtest-webdriver`
3.  integrate with the real application
